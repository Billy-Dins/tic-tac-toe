## The Odin Project
This project was built using [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)
The intent of this project is to use as little global code as possible. Instead trying to store everything inside of a module or factory.

## Challenges
This was my biggest project with the most moving parts yet. As such I had many challenges melding everything together. As mentioned above, the project put emphasis on creating modular code and this was one of my first attempts where I wrote everything entirely by myself.

----- to do: 19 Dec 2022 -----

1. code is super sloppy and not as module as I would like.
  - One module for initializing the gameboard on start up.
  - One module to loop through upon player action that renders the gameboard and checks win conditions.
2. Add a better opponent.
