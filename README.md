## The Odin Project
This project was built using [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)
The intent of this project is to use as little global code as possible. Instead trying to store everything inside of a module or factory.

## Challenges
This was my biggest project with the most moving parts yet. As such I had many challenges melding everything together. As mentioned above, the project put emphasis on creating modular code. A problem I encoutered and have yet to solve is creating an algorithm that changes the difficulty of the AI opponent. as of right now, the computer opponent simply selects a space on the board that is available instead of weighing the best option.
